# Physics-Guided-Degradation-State-Space-Modeling-for-Tool-Wear-Failure-Analysis
Physics-guided dual-scale degradation state-space modeling for failure-consistent tool wear evolution and remaining useful life assessment, with uncertainty quantification.

This repository provides the implementation of a physics-guided dual-scale degradation state-space framework for failure-consistent modeling of tool wear evolution and remaining useful life (RUL) in machining systems. The method enforces monotonic and irreversible degradation behavior while integrating multi-sensor data and uncertainty quantification to support engineering failure analysis and maintenance decision-making.

**Key Contributions:**

Physics-guided degradation state-space modeling of tool wear
Explicit enforcement of monotonic and irreversible damage accumulation
Dual-scale temporal modeling of wear evolution
Unified estimation of flute-level wear, total wear, and RUL
Uncertainty-aware failure assessment
